# MonzoClone
I'm going to clone the Monzo 'Home' screen, payment info screens, and 'Summary' screen, using Swift. The data will be pulled from my Monzo account....https://developers.monzo.com. I will develop the app further to include new ways of visualising my spending, e.g. custom graphs, custom stats
