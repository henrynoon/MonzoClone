# MonzoClone
I'm going to replicate the Monzo 'Home' screen, payment info screens, and 'Summary' screen, using Swift. The data will be pulled from my Monzo account....https://developers.monzo.com. I will develop the app further to include new ways of visualising my spending, e.g. custom graphs, custom stats.

How am I doing this?
1) Starting with the View Controller that displays information about a payment. I've determined that it's a Collection View made with 6 sections. Sections 0-4 have headers. All six sections have cells. The final section, section 5, has a footer.
